# 📘 Python Syntax & Basic Programming Concepts

## 🧭 Overview

Before diving deeper into data types and operations, it's essential to understand how Python is structured. Python emphasizes **readability**, making it beginner-friendly — but it also has strict rules on **indentation**, **naming**, and **code blocks** that form the foundation for every program you'll write.

## 🧱 Python Syntax Essentials

### 🔹 Statements and Expressions

In Python, a **statement** is a line of code that performs an action. An **expression** is something that produces a value.

```python
# Expression
2 + 3         # ➜ 5

# Statement
message = "Hello"  # Assigns value to a variable
```

Every line in Python is a statement by default unless it's inside a multi-line construct.

---

### 🔹 Print Statement

Used to display output:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")  # ➜ Hello, Python!
```

---

### 🔹 Comments

Comments are lines ignored by Python. They're used to explain code.

```python
# This is a comment
print("Run this")  # This prints a message
```

To write **multi-line comments**, use triple quotes:

<pre>
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
</pre>

---

### 🔹 Indentation: Python's Way of Grouping Code

Unlike other languages that use `{}` to define blocks, Python uses **indentation**.

```python
if True:
    print("This is inside the block")  # Indented ➜ belongs to the if statement
print("This is outside the block")
```

**Always use 4 spaces** (not tabs) for indentation in Python.

Incorrect indentation will raise an error:

```python
if True:
print("Missing indentation")  # ❌ This will cause an IndentationError
```

### 🔹 Naming Variables & Functions

Follow these rules when naming:

| Rule                           | Example         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Use letters, numbers, and `_`  | `user_name`     |
| Must not start with a number   | `2value` ❌      |
| Case sensitive                 | `Age` ≠ `age`   |
| Cannot use reserved keywords   | `if`, `class` ❌ |

✅ Valid:
```python
age = 21
user_name = "Alice"
total_Amount = 500
```

❌ Invalid:
```python
2nd_place = "Bob"     # starts with number
class = "Python101"   # 'class' is a reserved word
```

---

### 🔹 Code Blocks

Python uses **indentation to define blocks** like:

- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Function definitions
- Class definitions

```python
def greet():
    print("Hi there!")  # This belongs to the function

greet()  # Function call
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Use descriptive names for variables
- Keep comments meaningful and up to date
- Write clean and readable code
- Avoid using short or ambiguous variable names like `x`, `val`, unless necessary

| Concept        | Description                                           | Example                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Statement      | Code that performs an action                          | `x = 5`                      |
| Expression     | Code that returns a value                             | `2 + 3`                      |
| Comment        | Ignored line used for explanation                     | `# This is a comment`        |
| Indentation    | Defines blocks of code                                | `if x > 0:` then indent      |
| Naming Rules   | Guidelines for valid variable/function names          | `user_name`, not `2nd`       |

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Create a script called `syntax_basics.py` and try the following:

```python
# Simple Python Program
name = "Python"
print("Hello,", name)

# Conditional
if name == "Python":
    print("You're learning Python syntax!")
```
