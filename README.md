# 🐍 Day 1: Hello, Python!

---

## 🧭 Overview

Python is one of the most versatile programming languages in the world. It's widely used in **automation**, **data science**, **web development**, and more. Known for its simple syntax and powerful libraries, Python is often called the **Swiss Army knife** of programming.

This module introduces what Python is, how to begin writing code, and the two common environments where Python is executed: **interactive shells** and **scripts**.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

### 🔹 The Origin of Python
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** as a hobby project.
- It evolved into a **general-purpose, open-source** language used globally.
- A strong ecosystem of **packages** grew around it—especially for data science, visualization, and automation.

### 🔹 Learning by Doing
- Python is best learned interactively: try, test, and fix.
- Two main tools for writing and testing Python code:
  - **Interactive Python Shell (IPython)** — used for quick testing and experimentation.
  - **Python Scripts (`.py` files)** — store and run multiple commands in sequence.

### 🔹 IPython Shell
- Type code and instantly see results.
- Great for trying things on the fly:
  
  ```python
  4 + 5  # Output: 9
  ```

- **IPython**, short for **Interactive Python**, is a modern upgrade of the original Python shell.
- Part of the broader **Jupyter ecosystem**.

### 🔹 Python Scripts
- A `.py` file contains lines of code that can be executed together.
- To produce visible output, `print()` must be used:

  ```python
  # my_script.py
  print(4 + 5)
  ```

- Scripts improve structure and reusability.
- Changing the code is simple: edit and re-run the script.

### 🔹 How Output Works
- In a shell, typing `4 + 5` displays `9` automatically.
- In a script, without `print()`, there is no visible output.
- Always use `print()` when writing scripts to show results.

### 🔹 Code Environments
- Code can be written and executed in:
  - A **Python shell** for fast interaction.
  - A **code editor** or **IDE** (like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**) for structured development.
- Many learning platforms combine both for a hands-on experience.

## 💻 How to Install Python and Set Up VS Code

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
3. **Important**: During installation, check the box that says:  
   ✅ *"Add Python to PATH"*
4. Click “Install Now” and follow the instructions.
5. To confirm installation, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like `Python 3.x.x`.

---

### Step 2: Install VS Code

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the version for your operating system.
3. Launch VS Code.

---

### Step 3: Install the Python Extension in VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the **Extensions view** (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`).
3. Search for **“Python”** by Microsoft.
4. Click **Install**.

You’ll now be able to run Python code inside VS Code.

---

### Step 4: Write and Run Your First Python Script

1. In VS Code, create a new file and name it `hello.py`.
2. Type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, Python World!")
```

3. Save the file (`Ctrl + S`).
4. Right-click anywhere in the editor and choose **"Run Python File in Terminal"**.

You should see:

```
Hello, Python World!
```

🎉 You’ve just run your first Python script!
